		/**
		 * Stores node and edge data of a graph in a distributed fashion across multiple ranks.
		 *
		 * This class stores the parallel relationships of nodes and edges.
		 * When a node is added, it can be assigned as a local or ghost node. Each unique node
		 * can be added locally to one process, and as a ghost node to multiple processes.
		 * Upon finalizing the graph, the rank relationships are stored internally, including who
		 * are the owners of the various ghost nodes and a suitable connectivity graph is built.
		 *
		 * In addition, every node is assigned both a global ID and a local ID, such that it can be
		 * used to track the location of data for data exchanges by replicating the same index scheme
		 * in local arrays.
		 *
		 * In a finalized graph, the nodes are ordered such that local nodes have a lower localID than
		 * than any ghost nodes - i.e. the localID range is divided into [Locally Owned Nodes] | [Ghost Owned Nodes].
		 * This is to help faciliate looping over local or ghost nodes by range.
		 *
		 * In non-finalized graphs, this localID ordering is unknown/likely dependent on order of node addition,
		 * but in non-finalized graphs any retrieved node data should be treated as unreliable/incorrect/subject to
		 * change - functions that should depend on the graph being finalizsed should have a finalize check that
		 * errors if the graph is not finalized.
