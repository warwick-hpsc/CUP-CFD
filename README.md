# Overview

CUP-CFD - (Combusting Unstructured-grid Pressure-based CFD

CUP-CFD is intended to capture the key performance characteristics of a parallelised combusting-particle unstructured-grid CFD solver. This also enables calibration of a corresponding performance model of the solver.

CUP-CFD is composed of four benchmarks, each capturing one specific characteristic, to provide important performance data:
- Particle System: generate particles and track across MPI ranks as they traverse the specified volume
- Exchange: perform one specific communication pattern, either pair-wise exchange across unstructured-grid or a MPI collective operation
- Linear solver: integration with PETSc linear system solver, and transferring data between PETSc's parallel matrix decomposition and CUP-CFD's grid partitioning
- Kernels: integration of various Dolfyn CFD kernels to perform unstructured-grid CFD arithmetic

# Build Guide 

## Running the build system

CUP-CFD uses a cmake build system.

To assist with compilation, particularly with specifying location of dependencies, a Bash script has been provided:

```Shell
compile.sh
```

To build, run the following commands:

```Shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
         -DHDF5_ROOT="$HDF5_ROOT" \
         -DMETIS_ROOT="$METIS_ROOT" \
         -DPARMETIS_ROOT="$PARMETIS_ROOT" \
         -DPETSC_ROOT="$PETSC_ROOT" \
         -DSQLITE_LIBS="$SQLITE_ROOT"/lib/libsqlite3.so \
         -DTREETIMER_LIBS="$TREETIMER_ROOT"/libtt.so \
         -DTREETIMER_INCLUDE="$TREETIMER_ROOT"/include/timing_library/interface \
         -DUSE_UNIT_TESTS=OFF
```

There is a provision for disabling building with HDF5, Metis/Parmetis and/or PETSc via the USE_<Package> flags in CMakeLists.txt. However this setup is untested and likely to break compilation currently, since there are likely components that need wrapping with ifdefs (e.g. header includes, interface passthroughs). Expansion to make them optional is a future task.

## Header Override Values

The following values are defined in header files, but it may be desired for experimental purposes to override them:

- Pad/Increase the size of the CupCfdAoSMeshBoundary class in an AoS Mesh beyond that of the required values. This is to measure the impact of the class size in an AoS setting.
  - CUPCFD_AOS_MESH_BOUNDARY_PADDING

- Pad/Increase the size of the CupCfdAoSMeshCell class in an AoS Mesh beyond that of the required values. This is to measure the impact of the class size in an AoS setting.
  - CUPCFD_AOS_MESH_CELL_PADDING

- Pad/Increase the size of the CupCfdAoSMeshFace class in an AoS Mesh beyond that of the required values. This is to measure the impact of the class size in an AoS setting.
  - CUPCFD_AOS_MESH_FACE_PADDING

- Pad/Increase the size of the CupCfdAoSMeshRegion class in an AoS Mesh beyond that of the required values. This is to measure the impact of the class size in an AoS setting.
  - CUPCFD_AOS_MESH_REGION_PADDING

- Pad/Increase the size of the CupCfdAoSMeshVertex class in an AoS Mesh beyond that of the required values. This is to measure the impact of the class size in an AoS setting.
  - CUPCFD_AOS_MESH_VERTEX_PADDING

## Unit Tests

A number of units are provided for testing the code using Boost. The majority of the critical components should currently be covered (although there remains some further development to be done). However building these unit tests can significantly inflate the build time, and building them requires a dependancy on the boost unit tests library. As such they can be disabled via the use of the *USE_UNIT_TESTS* flag under the cmake system.

If they are built, they can be run using the command "ctest" in the build directory. Some tests test parallel functionality, and will run using 4 MPI processes. The mpi command used to run this is defined by the *MPIRUN_EXEC* flag in the cmake system, but defaults to srun in CMakeLists.txt (or could be changed in the CMakeLists.txt file).

# Run Guide 

## CUP-CFD Operation

CUP-CFD can be run simply with the command

``` Shell
mpirun -n <number of processes> cupcfd
```

    }
 ```

# TreeTimer

The TreeTimer Library is a custom library intended to capture data about instrumented blocks in the code. It tracks the relationship between codeblocks based on how they are nested in one another akin to a callpath tree. In each block, as well as timing data, it can also store 'local' parameters that are associated with the block in which they are stored, and 'global' parameters that can be associated with an entire run.

# Usage

## Postprocessing

The library itself must be initialised with TreeTimerInit() prior to any blocks, and finalized with TreeTimerFinalize() to write out its results. The results are currently written out to an SQLite Database for postprocessing, such as by the example python script provided at scripts/treetimer-postprocessing.

The script can be used by running it with the path to a SQlite database file output by the instrumentation library as an argument. A small selection of post-processing methods can be selected by uncommenting the appropriate method.

## Instrumentation

Timer Blocks are started with a entry method call associated with a "BlockName", beginning a timing/parameter data capture.
Timer Blocks are ended with a exit method call associated with a "BlockName", ending the timing of the current block entry and storing either a new trace entry or adding to the aggregate data. Please note that if the exit blockname differs from the name of the current block the library thinks it is in, a warning will be printed since the data will be invalid (i.e. the entry/exits should match in a stacking order if they are nested)

Different types of entry/exit methods are used to tracked different types of blocks - e.g. method calls, compute, MPI etc.
The selection can be found in tt_interface_c.h and is currently as follows:

TreeTimer[Enter|Exit]BlockMethod(<Name>) : Enter/Exit a Method Call (typically used at start and end of methods)
TreeTimer[Enter|Exit]BlockLoop(<Name>) : Enter/Exit an arbitrary loop
TreeTimer[Enter|Exit]BlockComputeLoop(<Name>) : Enter/Exit a compute loop
TreeTimer[Enter|Exit]BlockUnspecified(<Name>) : Enter/Exit a custom block not specifically associated with a type of behaviour
TreeTimer[Enter|Exit]BlockNonMPICall(<Name>) : Enter/Exit a Non-MPI method call (similiar to BlockMethod, but might be used for third-party library calls)
TreeTimer[Enter|Exit]BlockMPICommCall(<Name>) : Enter/Exit a MPI Call that uses communications
TreeTimer[Enter|Exit]BlockMPINOnCommCall(<Name>) : Enter/Exit a MPI call that does not use communications
TreeTimer[Enter|Exit]BlockIOCall(<Name>) : Enter/exit an I/O Block.

These use of these is effectively arbitrary - these methods do not do anything special to detect the types of behaviours. It is just the case that which method is used
determines what type of behaviour is associated with the timer block in the output data/post-processing.

Local Parameters can be tracked using the following methods:

TreeTimerLogParameterInt(<"name">, value) : Stores an integer value associated with the parameter "name" and the block the library is currently in (i.e. the last entered but not exited)
TreeTimerLogParameterDouble(<"name">, value) : Stores an double value associated with the parameter "name" and the block the library is currently in (i.e. the last entered but not exited)
TreeTimerLogParameterBool(<"name">, value) : Stores an bool value associated with the parameter "name" and the block the library is currently in (i.e. the last entered but not exited)
TreeTimerLogParameterString(<"name">, value) : Stores an string associated with the parameter "name" and the block the library is currently in (i.e. the last entered but not exited)

Global equivalents can be stored in a similar fashion, but they are not associated with any particular block.

TreeTimerLogGlobalParameterInt
TreeTimerLogGlobalParameterDouble
TreeTimerLogGlobalParameterBool
TreeTimerLogGlobalParameterString

To use these operations the file tt_interface_c.h should be included.
Please see the src code in the benchmarks folder for examples of its usage.
Currently a Fortran and C interface exists (CupCfd uses the C interface)

The data storage layout is too lengthy to detail here, but the schemas used can be found in treetimer/src/database/sqlite3/ folder.

Provision is made to store machine data in a location in the database, but this data is not currently captured and thus these tables in the database remain empty.

## Runtime Options

The TreeTimer Library has a number of configuration options that can be set at runtime via the use of enviromental parameters:

TT_CONFIG_APPNAME : String. This environment variable contains the application name that will be associated with the results in the database.

Aggregate Data: This will store aggregated data to minimise data output.
TT_CONFIG_ATIMERS : [0|1] If set to 1, this enables aggregate timing data for a block. 0 disables this option. By default it is on if unset.
TT_CONFIG_APARAM : [0:1] If set to 1, this enables aggregate parameter data for a block. 0 disables this option. By default it is on if unset.
TT_CONFIG_APAPI : [0:1] If set to 1, this enables aggregate papi data for a block. 0 disables this option. This is a placeholder - PAPI is not yet included in this version.

Trace Data: This will store a unique data entry for every block entry/exit, enabling traces to be reconstructed.
TT_CONFIG_TTIMERS : [0|1] If set to 1, this enables trace timing data for a block. 0 disables this option. By default it is on if unset.
TT_CONFIG_TPARAM : [0:1] If set to 1, this enables trace parameter data for a block. 0 disables this option. By default it is on if unset.
TT_CONFIG_TPAPI : [0:1] If set to 1, this enables trace papi data for a block. 0 disables this option. This is a placeholder - PAPI is not yet included in this version.

TT_CONFIG_MPI_HOOKS: [0|1] If set to 1, this enables the wrapping of all MPI function calls (at least, those implemented in the library) such that MPI specific
data including times, destinations, byte sizes, buffer sizes etc will be captured (depending on the type of call). 
0 disables this option. This option is also influenced by the aggreate/trace configuration options - i.e. if trace is enabled then trace data should be stored for MPI calls.

This particular options requires the use of LD_PRELOAD and a shared treetimer library to be effective, since it utilises PMPI to catch MPI calls. It may work without LD_PRELOAD
or a static library, but is not guaranteed or recommended since it will likely depend upon linking orders.

# Doxygen Guide

Most of the documentation for CUP-CFD can be found in the form of doxygen comments in the header files. This documentation can be generated using
the doxygen scripts under ./scripts, and the documentation can be navigated from docs/doxygen/html/index.html.
